## Department Store CRUD
This is my implementation of the CRUD project made by Nelio Alves in his [Udemy Java Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/).

This project has the best practices when using Spring Boot, a Component and Entity structure, Services and Repositories for handling database operations, as well as custom exception handling on the controllers.
The data is saved in memory, using the H2 database.

Available endpoints are shown below. You can find a Postman collection in the root folder of this project.
